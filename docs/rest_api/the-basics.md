# ZENZO Forge REST API

## The Basics
**Description:** This is a guide into the basics of how the ZENZO Forge REST API functions and how to interact with the API using Postman.

The Forge REST API uses `POST` HTTP requests, with some endpoints being public (and unauthenticated) and other endpoints being private, requiring an `auth` token that gets randomly generated everytime a Forge Node restarts.




## Setting up the environment
1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Forge running.
2. Download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
3. Run and setup Postman, then hit **"New"**, then **"Request"**, then set **"GET"** to **"POST"** and add **"Content-Type"** as **"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"**.
4. Add the root host to the endpoint, this should be `http://localhost` for most people.




## How to use the API
First you must decide which API **Endpoint** you want to call, for instance, calling `/forge/items` is the "Forge Items" endpoint, which returns a list of all known Forge items.

Some APIs require additional information, such as **Body** keys and properties, you can add/remove Body properties with the "**Body"** tab and checking the `x-www-form-urlencoded` option.

For example, using the `/forge/smelt` endpoint requires an **"auth"** and a **"hash"** key. The "auth" is the authkey generated by the local Forge Node (Which can be found in the debug console), and the "hash" key is the TX-ID of the item you want to smelt.
